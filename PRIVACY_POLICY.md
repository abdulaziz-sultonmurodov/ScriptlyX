**Last Updated: January 2025**

## Overview

ScriptlyX is a browser extension that provides text translation and transliteration services. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection

### What We Do NOT Collect

- We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal information
- We do NOT track your browsing history
- We do NOT collect analytics or usage statistics
- We do NOT use cookies for tracking purposes

### What We Process

ScriptlyX processes text only when you explicitly request a translation or transliteration:

1. **Transliteration (Script Conversion)**: Text is converted locally on your device. No data is sent to any server.

2. **Translation**: When you request a translation, the selected text is sent to third-party translation APIs (Google Translate, MyMemory, or LibreTranslate) to perform the translation. This data is:
   - Sent only when you explicitly trigger a translation
   - Not stored by ScriptlyX
   - Subject to the privacy policies of the respective translation services

### Local Storage

ScriptlyX stores the following data locally on your device using Chrome's sync storage:

- Extension enabled/disabled preference
- Notification preferences
- Preferred language settings

This data is stored locally and synced across your Chrome browsers if you are signed in to Chrome. We do not have access to this data.

## Third-Party Services

When using the translation feature, your text may be processed by:

- **Google Translate** (https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- **MyMemory** (https://mymemory.translated.net/doc/privacy.php)
- **LibreTranslate** (varies by instance)

Please review their respective privacy policies for information on how they handle data.

## Permissions
